Hi I am Paul Fix, aka Van Goat. 

This is me learning more about github because setting up a perforce server is pretty annoying. It was easier and faster to get this setup.
As we learn more about github we are seeing the benefits of using github. The team is excited to dive deeper in our projects repository.
